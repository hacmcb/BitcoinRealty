# BitcoinRealty
Bitcoin Realty (codename BTCRAT) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height 550,000, at roughly December 31, 2017. UTC  At the predetermined block height, Bitcoin Platinum miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.
